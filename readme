AUDITORY DEBUGGER (audbg)

This tiny C program will start a process of your choice and attach to it with
ptrace (acting like a debugger). It then single steps through the process and
writes some information about the process to standard output on every step. The
intended use case is to write the program counter or other register on each
step of the process, and then pipe that data to an audio player so that you can
hear the internal state of the process.

Why? Just for fun :)

Compile with:
$ gcc -O3 audbg.c -oaudbg

Example usage:
$ ./audbg /path/to/child child args | aplay -c2 -r96 -fS16_LE

Having issues? You may need to run this:
$ sudo sysctl kernel.yama.ptrace_scope=0
